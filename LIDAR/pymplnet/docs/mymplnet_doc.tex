\section{Description}
(PLACEHOLDER)
The objective of this project is to develop a functional graphical user interface 
for seamless communication and data retrieval from NASA's Micro Pulse Lidar Network 
(MPLNet). \\

The application is designed to streamline the downloading process, providing 
users with a user-friendly interface while eliminating the need for direct access 
to NASA's data site. \\

It enables comprehensive data selection from AppState's MPLNet 
site, facilitating the aggregation and transformation of data from netCDF4 format 
to CSV format. This enhancement aims to expedite further research endeavors.
