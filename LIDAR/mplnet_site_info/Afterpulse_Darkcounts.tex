\noindent\textbf{\LARGE Afterpulse}

\begin{myitemize}
\item Entire procedure takes place in the same hour, starting at the top of the hour
\item Stop collection with the SigmaMPL software just after the hour mark
\begin{myitemize}
\item The \textbf{Stop Collection} button \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{stopcollection_button.png} is on the 
	\textbf{Hardware} tab \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{hardware_tab.png}
\end{myitemize}
\item Place the cover on the laser
\item With the \textbf{cover on, laser on, shutter on} run collection for approximately 30-35 minutes
\item Stop collection and close completely out of SigmaMPL program
\item Find file created for the time frame and modify the file name to xxx.\textbf{ap}.mpl
\begin{myitemize}
\item File will be located in the data folder and named YYYYMMDDHHMM.mpl
\item Where YYYY is year, MM month, DD day, HH hours, and MM minutes
\item Example: 202205190145.mpl would be renamed to 202205190145.ap.mpl
\item Data Folder Path:\begin{verbatim}C:/Program Files (x86)/SigmaMPL/DATA/\end{verbatim}
\end{myitemize}

\end{myitemize}

\noindent\textbf{\LARGE Dark Counts}

\begin{myitemize}
\item Ensure collection is off from the end of afterpulse procedure (SigmaMPL may still be closed at this point)
\begin{myitemize}
\item The \textbf{Stop Collection} button \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{stopcollection_button.png} is on the 
	\textbf{Hardware} tab \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{hardware_tab.png}
\end{myitemize}
\item Turn the \textbf{shutter off} on the Photonics controller
\begin{myitemize}
\item This button is located physically on the controller beneath the Lidar
\end{myitemize}
\item Allow the laser to sit for approximately 10 minutes to allow for the residual photons to dissipate
\item Open the SigmaMPL software if not currently open {\begingroup

\item With the \textbf{cover on, laser on, shutter off} run collection for approximately 10 minutes
\begin{myitemize}
\item The \textbf{Start Collection} button is on the \textbf{Hardware} tab \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{hardware_tab.png}
\end{myitemize}
\item Stop collection and close completely out of the SigmaMPL program
\item Find file created for the time frame and modify the file name to xxx.\textbf{dc}.mpl
\begin{myitemize}
\item File will be located in the data folder and named YYYYMMDDHHMM.mpl
\item Where YYYY is year, MM month, DD day, HH hours, and MM minutes
\item Example: 202205190145.mpl would be renamed to 202205190145.dc.mpl
\item Data Folder Path:\begin{verbatim}C:/Program Files (x86)/SigmaMPL/DATA/\end{verbatim}
\end{myitemize}
\end{myitemize}

\noindent\textbf{\LARGE Completion}

\begin{myitemize}
\item With \textbf{cover off, laser on, shutter on} restart normal collection at the top of the hour
\item Ensure that data is transferred at 5 minutes after the hour
\end{myitemize}
	
\newpage
\noindent\textbf{\large Notes}\\

\noindent Afterpulse raw data should show a reading at the lowest level (cover on), with no higher altitude counts.\\ 

\noindent Dark counts should have no reading at all due to shutter being closed.\\
